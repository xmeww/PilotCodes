% INFO: PTB's Screen('Flip', 10) command seems to have missed the requested stimulus presentation deadline
% INFO: a total of 4 times out of a total of 22348 flips during this session.

% INFO: This number is fairly accurate (and indicative of real timing problems in your own code or your system)
% INFO: if you provided requested stimulus onset times with the 'when' argument of Screen('Flip', window [, when]);
% INFO: If you called Screen('Flip', window); without the 'when' argument, this count is more of a ''mild'' indicator
% INFO: of timing behaviour than a hard reliable measurement. Large numbers may indicate problems and should at least
% INFO: deserve your closer attention. Cfe. 'help SyncTrouble', the FAQ section at www.psychtoolbox.org and the
% INFO: examples in the PDF presentation in PsychDocumentation/Psychtoolbox3-Slides.pdf for more info and timing tips.
